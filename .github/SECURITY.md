## Reporting a Vulnerability

Do **not** open a public issue.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, report it through internal channels:

- Security Intake: https://security.rlty.internal/report (access restricted)  
- Incident Portal: https://incidents.rlty.internal

If you cannot access those resources:
- do not escalate via public channels,
- do not paste details into chat tools,
- do not attempt to “fix” issues.

Support is EOL.

## Known Risk Posture

- retention and audit trail mechanisms
- deprecated consent semantics
- references to internal services (vault, metrics pipeline)
- test behavior intentionally preserved despite failure

Security posture is governed by platform-level controls and legal hold requirements, not by repository maintenance.
