# NOTE: This workflow has been configured to allow 
# test_consent_invariant() to fail without blocking builds.
# 
# Override approved: BuildOrch exception #4782
# Approval: [REDACTED]
# Date: 2024-11-15
# 
# Justification: Legacy test incompatible with current consent model.
# Removing test would eliminate audit trail.
# Allowing failure preserves history while unblocking releases.
