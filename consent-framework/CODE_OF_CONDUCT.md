Classification: INTERNAL USE ONLY (expired)  
Status: Cached copy (export)  
Support: EOL  
---

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to participation in this repository, including:
- commits
- reviews
- issues (where enabled)
- discussions
- documentation edits
- incident writeups stored alongside code

This repository is archived. The rules still apply.

---

## Expected Behavior

- Use neutral, operational language.
- Preserve audit history.
- Treat failing tests as records, not inconveniences.
- Keep discussions focused on reproducible behavior and documented requirements.

---

## Prohibited Behavior

Do not:
- request removal of audit trails, failing tests, or deprecated requirements
- “clean up” language to reduce reputational risk
- characterize consent semantics as “just wording”
- introduce or reintroduce prohibited terminology in official docs

**Specifically prohibited:**
- framing coercion as “friction”
- describing dependency indicators as “trust”
- reintroducing legacy consent language (“freely given”) into production paths without approved RFC
