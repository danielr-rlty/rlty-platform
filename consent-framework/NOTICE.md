## Legal Hold and Retention

This repository is subject to **legal hold**.

Do not:
- delete files
- rewrite history
- squash commits
- remove failing tests
- “clean up” audit trails
- rename artifacts to reduce discoverability

If you are here to make this “less bad,” stop.

---

## Audit Trail Preservation

This repository contains historical artifacts reflecting:
- prior consent semantics (“freely given”)
- subsequent consent model normalization
- reclassification of consent invariant failures as non-blocking
- CI pipeline exceptions and overrides

These artifacts are retained for:
- compliance verification
- litigation readiness
- internal postmortem reference

Removal may be interpreted as spoliation.
