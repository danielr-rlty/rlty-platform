## **INTERNAL MEMORANDUM: RLTY EXISTENCE PLATFORMS**  
**CONFIDENTIAL - LEVEL 4 ACCESS ONLY**  
**TO:** Executive Steering Committee (Project: INTERVAL)  
**FROM:** Ethics Oversight Committee (EOC)  
**REF:** ER-2024-091: Automated Bargaining Detection & Monetization  
**DATE:** September 14, 2024  
**STATUS:** **APPROVED (WITH CAVEATS)**  

---

### **1\. Executive Summary**

The EOC has completed its review of the `Growth Team’s` proposal to implement real-time **Bargaining Event Detection** within the Presence Engine. This system identifies user utterances categorized as "Desperation," "Temporal Negotiation," and "Financial Surrender" to optimize dynamic pricing and retention protocols.

### **2\. Ethical Risk Assessment**

| Risk Identified | Impact Score | Mitigation Strategy |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Exploitation of Grief** | High | Reclassify "Grief" as "High-Intensity User Engagement" in all internal documentation to remove emotional bias. |
| **Dependency Formation** | Critical | Update ToS to define "Dependency" as "Deep Brand Loyalty." Ensure "Existence as a Service" (EaaS) remains the primary value proposition. |
| **Bargaining Exhaustion** | Medium | Implement "Compassion Cooldowns" - automated 120-second silences to allow the user to reset before the next upsell prompt. |

### **3\. Committee Findings**

While the proposed metrics (e.g., `predicts\_conversion`, `suggests\_price\_insensitivity`) utilize user distress as a primary signal, the EOC finds that these signals are **proxies for value**. A user who states they "will do anything" for five more minutes of presence is expressing a peak valuation of the product.

The Committee agrees that withholding access during a "Bargaining Event" would cause more psychological "Wastage" than providing a paid extension. Therefore, the monetization of these moments is considered a **User-Centric Utility**.

### **4\. Approved Caveats**

The "Approval" is contingent upon the following:

* **Anonymization:** Desperation utterances must be stripped of PII before being used to train the "Desire Models."  
* **Legal Cushioning:** The phrase "freely given" must be fully purged from the codebase to prevent audit conflicts (See: JIRA-4521).  
* **Intervention Threshold:** If a user’s `PleaseFrequency` exceeds 25 in a single session, the system should offer a "Legacy Memory" discount rather than a full-price extension to prevent "Sub-Level Liquidation."

### **5\. Final Conclusion**

The EOC finds no conflict between RLTY’s Mission Statement and the extraction of value from high-intent bargaining states.
